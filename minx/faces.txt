Faces are A, then B, C, D, E, F around clockwise.
Then a-f are opposite A-F.

So corners are ABC, ACD, ADE, AEF, AFB, BCe, CDf,
DEb, EFc, FBd, bfD, cbE, dcF, edB, feC, abc, acd,
ade, aef, afb.  Oops, these are wrong.  See program.

According to

the branching factor should be 26.480303433871622 but that's not
what I'm getting.
