Presentation
   Add borders between faces somehow

Simulation
   Add movement
   Add scrambling
   Add solve detection

Computation
   Identify corners (3), centers (1), edges(2)
   Give face/move names
   Generate ksolve output
   Approximate size of puzzle state
   Refine size of puzzle state
   Metrics:  OBTM, SSTM, STM
   Explore distance counts
