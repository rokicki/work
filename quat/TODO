Presentation
   Add borders between faces somehow

Simulation
   Add movement
   Add scrambling
   Add solve detection

Computation
   Figure out how to deal with puzzle rotations
   Figure out how to deal with identical pieces
   Identify corners (3), centers (1), edges(2)
   Give face/move names
   Generate ksolve output
   Approximate size of puzzle state
   Refine size of puzzle state
   Metrics:  OBTM, SSTM, STM
   Explore distance counts
