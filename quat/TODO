Presentation
   Add borders between faces somehow

Simulation
   Add movement
   Add scrambling
   Add solve detection

Computation
   Identify moves
   Identify moving "pieces" (collections of faces)
   Calculate orbits
   Approximate size of puzzle state
   Refine size of puzzle state
   Generate permutation representation
   Metrics:  OBTM, SSTM, STM
   Explore distance counts
