Generate flattened SVG net representation to integrate with Lucas

Note:  Gelatinbrain/Magic Polyhedra does almost everything better at
this point . . .

Catchup
   Add GAP file generation
   Add ksolve file generation

Presentation
   Add one-face display
   Add borders between faces somehow

Simulation
   Add movement
   Add scrambling
   Add solve detection

Computation
   Figure out how to deal with puzzle rotations
   Figure out how to deal with identical pieces
   Figure out how to deal with multi-solution puzzles (dino)
   Give face/move names
   Approximate size of puzzle state
   Refine size of puzzle state
   Metrics:  OBTM, SSTM, STM
   Explore distance counts

For complicated puzzles, rather than making so many faces at the 3D
layer, instead use fewer faces and use texturing to draw stickers and
sticker separations.

Don't limit move "planes" to slices; allow the move planes to be a
polytope symmetric around a line from the center of the puzzle.  This
permits us to build a lot more puzzles without increasing the sticker
count like crazy.

Permit move planes to be curved surfaces rather than slices (maybe
rotated splines).

Similar things:

gelatinbrain/magic polyhedra

Excellent UI, movement, macros/recording, etc.
Requires Windows/Linux/Mac (not webified)
Puzzles are compiled-in; can't add one dynamically
No jumbling, but tons of extra features
Hundreds of puzzles already

pcubes

Windows-only so I can't run and evaluate
Puzzles defined in XML, with custom scripting language for fancy features
Hundreds of puzzles already
Probably the best, most general program there is right now

Where we want to differ:

I'm mostly interested in computer solving/exploration.  So we want to
generate GAP and ksolve input files, we want to do cube-explorer type
things.  I'm more interested in this than in going crazy with all
possible puzzle types.  On the other hand, exploring the *space* of
puzzles (i.e., Platonic solids with cuts) is very interesting to me.

External libraries:

twistysim.js:

Cannot determine license terms
Can't find original (unobfuscated sources)
Rendering can be slow for big puzzles (svg/DOM)
Unintuitive mouse moves
Shows back of stickers *colored* during twists
No true slice turns (touch only works for simple cases)

three.js:

Fast!  Even for bigger puzzles
Have to do so much rendering work ourselves
Marks between faces not rendered
